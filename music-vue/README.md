# digitalNoise

## The concept: 

digitalNoise is a Transformed iteration of the Music Store Application from a console-based system into a user-friendly web application. Steaming from my deep passion for music, this application leverages PostgreSQL for database management, JDBC for database connectivity, Apache Commons DBCP2 for connection pooling and Responsive Design to enhance accessibility and functionality. It molds together my passion and my talent as a fullstack developer.
