### Music Store Application
Description: (Completed) A sophisticated Music Library and [Shopping Application](https://github.com/jackn513/projects/tree/main/music-application) designed to seamlessly engage with a comprehensive database. The Music Store Application, initially a console-based music database management system, now integrates connectivity with external APIs to expand its functionality. Designed to interact seamlessly with a PostgreSQL database named musicDB, the application offers a user-friendly, console-based interface for managing albums, artists, and related information. The existing implementation utilizes the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API to establish a secure connection to the database, coupled with Apache Commons DBCP2 for efficient connection pooling.

### FortuneTeller Java Project
Description: (Completed) [The FortuneTeller project](https://github.com/jackn513/projects/tree/main/Fortune%20Teller) is a simple console-based application designed to provide users with light-hearted and random fortune predictions based on their responses to three personalized questions. The program interacts with the user through the standard input (console) and utilizes basic string manipulations to generate a fortune based on the cumulative length of the user's inputs.
