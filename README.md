### FortuneTeller Java Project
Description: (Completed) [The FortuneTeller project](https://github.com/jackn513/projects/tree/main/Fortune%20Teller) is a simple console-based application designed to provide users with light-hearted and random fortune predictions based on their responses to three personalized questions. The program interacts with the user through the standard input (console) and utilizes basic string manipulations to generate a fortune based on the cumulative length of the user's inputs.
