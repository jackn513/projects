# digital noise online


digital noise online is the continuation of the Music Application project (Java) that's designed to
interact with a PostgreSQL database (musicDB) and provides a user-friendly interface for managing albums, artists, and related information. The project utilizes the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) API to establish a connection to the database, and Apache Commons DBCP2 for connection pooling. 

Now as a website, the goal of this project is to implement the same practices that the Music Application achieved. 


## HTML 

The `info.html` file provides the basic content of the site. From the text, the image, and the buttons. It's structure isn't entirely too complicated and is designed with the best semantic practices as possible.
